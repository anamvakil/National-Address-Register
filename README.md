# National Address Register — Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **normalized relational database** for a National Address Register dataset. The work demonstrates core **data engineering concepts**, including staging tables, normalization up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, and enforcement of referential integrity using SQL Server.

The project emphasizes transforming raw address-related data into a structured, maintainable database suitable for analytical and operational use.

---

## Project Type
**Group academic project** completed as part of a Data Engineering course.

---

## Objectives
- Load raw address data into staging tables
- Analyze data dependencies and normalize tables up to **3NF**
- Design a relational schema with appropriate primary and foreign keys
- Implement database objects using **T-SQL**
- Document design decisions, assumptions, and challenges

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server
- T-SQL
- Relational database design
- ERD modeling

## Key Work Completed
- Designed staging tables to support raw data ingestion
- Normalized address data into relational tables following **3NF principles**
- Implemented primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
- Developed T-SQL scripts for table creation and data transformation
- Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the final schema

---

## Authorship & Contribution
This project was completed as a **group academic assignment**.

While the work was collaborative, my **primary responsibilities** included:
- Designing the overall database schema and normalization strategy (up to 3NF)
- Creating and managing staging tables for raw data ingestion
- Developing the majority of T-SQL scripts for table creation and transformations
- Defining primary and foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity
- Preparing the ERD and supporting technical documentation

All team members contributed to the project.

## How to Use
1. Review the ERD in the `erd` folder to understand the database design
2. Refer to the project report for normalization steps and design rationale
3. Use the SQL scripts (if applicable) to recreate the database structure in SQL Server

---

## Project Context
This project demonstrates practical application of **data engineering fundamentals**, including schema design, normalization, and SQL-based implementation, using a real-world–style address dataset.
